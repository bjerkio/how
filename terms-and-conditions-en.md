# General Terms and Conditions for Bjerk AS

## Terms and Conditions

These general terms and conditions apply for services and products 
(Delivery) supplied by Bjerk AS (Supplier), unless otherwise agreed in 
writing between the Supplier and the customer (Customer) and/or 
regulated in specific conditions relating to each part of the Delivery.

## Definitions

“Bjerk AS” refers to Bjerk AS, a company registered in the Brønnøysund 
Register Centre with organisation number 998 732 867. “Customer” refers
to the person or body that orders a service or product from the Supplier.

## Electronic mail

The Customer accepts that data and documents, including all invoices, 
reminders and notices of debt collection, in connection with business 
matters shall be sent and stored electronically, including as e-mail.

## Subcontractors

The Supplier has the right to use subcontractors/third parties in connection
with the Delivery.

## Correct information
The Customer has a duty to provide the Supplier with all relevant 
information in connection with business matters and to continually update 
such information.  This also applies to the Customer’s own contact details. 
Similarly, the Customer must notify the Supplier of all applicable inquiries 
made to the Customer directly from third parties

If, as a consequence of the Customer’s breach of the obligations under this
clause, the Supplier should be made liable to a third party or incur other 
types of costs, the Customer shall be liable for these. 

## Prices/Value Added Tax

The Supplier’s indicative prices are quoted on the website, price list or in 
the specified offer/agreement. The website is regularly updated. The 
prices stipulated here are not to be considered binding for the Supplier 
since these may be adjusted at any time.

Prices specified in the Agreement will apply for the Delivery that is 
covered by the Agreement. If the price is not specified in the Agreement, 
the price specified in the Supplier’s offer will apply. If no offer was 
submitted, the price specified in the invoice that was issued for the 
services and products covered by the invoice shall apply.

Unless otherwise specifically stated, all prices are quoted exclusive of tax. 
A number of factors determine which rate of VAT is to be charged, 
including where the Customer is based.  The calculation of VAT will be 
detailed in the invoice and the rates specified in a separate overview

The agreed prices may be adjusted at the start of each year in accordance
with the increase in Statistics Norway’s consumer price index (main 
index). The first such adjustment will be based on the index for the month 
in which the Agreement was entered into. Agreed prices may also be 
adjusted if rules or decisions pertaining to public charges/taxes are 
amended and this has an effect on the Supplier’s remuneration or costs.

Unless otherwise specifically agreed, changes in prices for third-party 
deliveries that are part of the Delivery constitute grounds for claiming 
price adjustments for the Delivery.

## Invoicing and payment terms

Invoiced amounts fall due for payment in 10 (ten) calendar days.

If the amount due is not paid or is withheld by the payment service 
provider or correct payment is not made to the Supplier for other reasons, 
the order is still equally binding on the Customer. In these instances, 
correct payment must take place immediately.

The Supplier and cooperative partners of the Supplier may invoice 
additional amounts for any meetings with the Customer and for 
extraordinary work which the Customer requests to be carried out and 
which is not included in the Agreement. Additional amounts may also be 
invoiced for extraordinary expenses. The Customer must be informed of 
any extra invoicing in advance.

In the event of delayed payment, penalty interest shall be calculated 
pursuant to Act no. 100 of 17 December 1976 relating to interest on 
overdue payments, etc. (Interest on Overdue Payments Act). A reminder 
fee may also be charged in accordance with applicable regulations.

## Payment default

If undisputed remuneration that has fallen due for payment, as well as any
accrued penalty interest, has not been paid within 30 (thirty) calendar 
days from the due date, the Supplier may send written notice to the 
Customer that the Agreement will be terminated unless settlement takes 
place within 60 (sixty) calendar days after notice has been received.

## Credit check

All customers may be subject to credit checks. The Supplier reserves the 
right to refuse credit without further grounds.

## Cancellation

The Customer may cancel all or part of the Delivery to the extent to which 
this has been agreed. In that case, the Customer must pay for the part of 
the Delivery that has been supplied, as well as the Supplier’s costs and 
loss associated with cancellation.

## Third parties

Neither the Supplier, the Supplier’s employees nor the Supplier's 
cooperative partners may provide binding assurances that the Customer’s 
accounts, profiles, websites, etc., will and/or can (a) be established or 
uploaded to a third party’s systems (for example Facebook), (b) be 
approved or published by a third party (for example Facebook), and (c) not
be removed and/or deleted by a third party (for example Facebook) 
following establishment and publication.

A Delivery cannot be cancelled or refunded, even if one or more of the 
products or services provided by the Supplier is not permitted to be 
established, uploaded or published, or is removed/deleted, etc., by a third 
party (for example Facebook) and this is not due to circumstances on the 
part of the Supplier.  Under no circumstances can the Supplier, the 
Supplier’s employees or the Supplier's cooperative partners be held liable 
if content, information, etc., from the Customer violates a third party's 
rights.

## Complaints

Complaints must be submitted by the due date of the invoice received for 
the service or product for which a complaint is being made. Complaints 
after this point in time shall be deemed to have been submitted too late 
and will become void.

## Authority

The Customer shall grant the Supplier unlimited authority to, at any time, 
access all profiles, accounts, pages, etc., that may be necessary for the 
work the Supplier will perform, performs or has performed. The Supplier 
may also, at any time, register its own or cooperative partners’ 
administrative access to the Customer’s profiles, accounts, pages, etc. The

Customer shall grant the Supplier unlimited authority to establish, update, 
change and delete all profiles, accounts, pages, etc., that have been 
ordered by the Customer.

## Security interest/Provisos regarding right of ownership

The Supplier shall retain right of ownership to the Delivery until full 
remuneration has been paid, in addition to any interest and expenses in 
accordance with the Norwegian Mortgages and Pledges Act.

## Interpretation of the general terms and conditions

Should any part of these general terms and conditions be found to be 
invalid or unworkable under current legislation, the invalid or unworkable 
provision shall be considered as having been replaced by a valid and 
workable provision that, insofar as possible, corresponds with the purpose 
of the original provision and the remainder of the terms and conditions will
continue to apply.

The clause headings in these general terms and conditions are used solely
for the sake of expediency for the parties and have no legal or contractual 
significance.

## Use as a reference

The Supplier has the right to use everything relating to the Delivery as a 
reference. This includes, but is not limited to, stating that the Supplier has 
a customer relationship with the Customer, use of the Customer’s logo, 
presentation of the work performed, etc.

## Transfer of rights and obligations

The Supplier may transfer the Agreement/Delivery, in whole or in part, at 
any time, with or without notifying the Customer.  The Customer does not 
have the right to transfer the Agreement/Delivery without the written 
consent of the Supplier.

## Loss of data

Under no circumstances is the Supplier liable for the loss of data/stored 
information.

## Liability and indemnification

The Customer undertakes to indemnify the Supplier, the Supplier’s 
employees, and the Supplier’s cooperative partners, including with regard 
to third parties, for any damage and any loss in connection with the 
Delivery not being able to be delivered as agreed.

The Supplier has no liability for financial loss that is suffered by the 
Customer such as, but not limited to, non-materialisation of profits, 
expected savings, loss of income/earnings, loss of reputation, claims from 
third parties, including claims from third-party providers as a result of the 
Customer's breach of third-party conditions; or loss as a consequence of 
legal amendments or of decisions handed down by administrative bodies 
or courts; compulsory fines; damage to other property caused by the 
characteristics of the service/product; or other indirect damage, even if 
the Supplier has been made aware of the possibility of such damage 
occurring.

In all instances, any claim from the Customer with respect to adjustment 
of the remuneration payable and the Supplier’s liability for damages shall 
be limited to a total of 50% of the remuneration which the Customer has 
been invoiced in the 12 months prior to the date on which the complaint 
was made, provided that the Supplier is not guilty of gross negligence or 
wilful intent.

## Commercial purchases

The Customer is aware that all services provided by the Supplier shall be 
considered commercial purchases and that special provisions for 
consumer purchases shall therefore not apply.

## Duty of confidentiality

Confidential information which the parties become aware of in connection 
with the Delivery and execution of the Delivery must be treated 
confidentially and not be disclosed to outside parties without the consent 
of the other party.

The duty of confidentiality under this provision does not prevent the 
disclosure of information which is required to be presented pursuant to 
laws and regulations. If possible, the other party shall be notified before 
such information is disclosed. The duty of confidentiality does not prevent 
the information being used when there are no legitimate interests that 
would indicate that it should be kept confidential, for example, when this 
information is general knowledge or publicly available elsewhere. The 
parties shall take the necessary precautions to ensure that unauthorised 
parties cannot access or become aware of confidential information.

The duty of confidentiality applies to the parties’ employees, 
subcontractors and third parties acting on behalf of the parties in 
connection with the execution of the Agreement.

The duty of confidentiality shall not prevent the parties from utilising 
experience and expertise acquired in connection with execution of the 
Agreement.

The duty of confidentiality shall also apply after the Agreement has ended.
Employees or others who cease their employment with one of the parties 
shall also be subject to a duty of confidentiality regarding the 
aforementioned matters after their departure. Unless otherwise stipulated 
by law or regulations, the duty of confidentiality shall cease 5 (five) years 
after the Agreement comes to an end.

## Force Majeure

If an extraordinary situation should occur that makes it impossible to 
perform duties in accordance with the Agreement and which must be 
considered force majeure pursuant to Norwegian law, such as, but not 
limited to, strike, lockout, war or other circumstances outside of the 
parties’ control, the other party must be notified of this as soon as 
possible. The obligations of the impacted party will be suspended for as 
long as the extraordinary situation persists. The other party’s 
consideration will be suspended during the same period of time.

During force majeure situations, the other party may only terminate the 
Agreement with the impacted party's consent, or if the situation persists 
or is expected to persist for longer than 60 (sixty) calendar days, 
calculated from the date the situation arose and then only with 14 
(fourteen) calendar days’ notice. Each of the parties shall cover its own 
costs relating to termination of the contractual arrangement. The 
Customer shall pay the agreed price for the part of the Delivery that was 
supplied as agreed before the Agreement was terminated. The parties 
cannot bring claims against one another due to termination of the 
Agreement pursuant to this provision.

In connection with force majeure situations, the parties have a mutual 
duty to provide each other with information relating to all matters that 
must be assumed to be of importance to the other party. This information 
must be provided as promptly as possible.

## Choice of law and jurisdiction

Any conflict between the Customer and Supplier in connection with the 
Delivery and which is covered by the present terms and conditions is 
regulated by Norwegian law.

The parties agree to Oslo District Court in Norway as the correct legal 
venue. However, this choice of legal venue shall not prevent the Supplier 
from enforcing its ownership and intellectual property rights (including, 
but not limited to petitioning for an interim injunction) in other jurisdictions
and in accordance with the procedures and rules that apply at such a 
location.
