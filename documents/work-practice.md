# Guidelines for Work Practice

The objective of these guidelines is to ensure predictability among Bjerk
employees, allowing us to maintain efficiency, collaboration, and clear
communication, regardless of the workplace.

## The Importance of Predictability

Predictability ensures we are aware of when and where our colleagues are
working. Uncertainty, particularly concerning remote work, can create ambiguity
about whether a colleague is available, sick, or has other commitments. This can
disrupt the planning of the workday, create stress, and reduce interaction and
collaboration.

## Remote Work Guidelines

- **Planning:** To guarantee predictability, you should inform about your
  intention to work remotely before the start of the week (at least three days
  before staying home). This means establishing a plan for the upcoming week and
  communicating this plan before the weekend.

  We recommend that you work from home on the same days each week. This will
  make it easier for your colleagues to plan their workday and schedule meetings
  with you.

  **Tip**: Try to plan your workday for two weeks ahead, and communicate this
  plan to your colleagues.

- **Exceptions:** If unforeseen circumstances arise making it necessary to work
  from home without notice, this should be communicated as soon as possible,
  preferably the day or evening before.

## General Work Hours Guidelines

While Bjerk employees have the flexibility to work wherever and whenever they
choose, the standard is to work between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. This ensures that we
are available for collaboration with colleagues and clients.

If you plan to work outside of these hours or from a location other than normal
place of work, please notify at least three days in advance and make sure you
don't need to coordinate with anyone to do your job.
