# De-mystifying developer lingo

Software developers use words just like anyone would, and in order to bridge the gap between developers and non-developers when collaborating on projects, you can use this glossary to look up words you may not be familiar with, or that are used in a particular way in Bjerk that is not easy to uncover.

Lots of terms used in software development have been adapted from common language, so it can be quite hard to find a good definition.


## Version control, code review, deployment

In Bjerk, we use Git and GitHub to manage our code, coordinate tasks and maintain an extensive historical record of everything we do.

### Pull Request (PR)

When a developer writes some code to change something in a program it will be uploaded to GitHub and placed in a pull request, which lets other developers look at the code (aka. perform a code review), after which it will be approved and saved to the actual program's main code.

This ensures that the code is of high quality and also creates a good historical record to look back at in the future.

### Merge

To apply changes from one branch to another. Typically 

### Workflow

When we talk about a workflow, we are typically referring to a github workflow, which is an automated action that happens in the cloud when certain events happen. For example, a github workflow can automatically build and deploy a website when changes are made to the code.

### Deploy

To deploy our code means that we are sending the code to some server that will run the code, such as a server hosting a website.
