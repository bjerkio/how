# Data Organization

As means to protect our customers data and user privacy, we have a few policies on data organization.
Mainly, we use Google Workspace to store documents and GitHub to store source code and project management.

For now, we have a somewhat strict policy regarding documentation stored in Google Workspace.

- Customer-related content should always be stored in _Shared Drives_
- Files should be named starting with a ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD) and a title describing the file (think of search indexing)
- Shared drives that are _owned_ or considered internal should be prefixed with _Bjerk_ followed by a slash (e.g. `Bjerk / Hello World`)

Theres a [video that explains some of these consepts][data-video], feel free to redistribute it to colleagues or ask questions about
it under issues in this repository.
