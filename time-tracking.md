# Policies for Time Tracking

Time tracking is a critical part of the work we do at Bjerk. It helps us
understand how we're spending our time, and it helps us make sure we're billing
our clients correctly. This document describes the policies around time tracking
at Bjerk.

## Time tracking is mandatory

All Bjerk employees are required to track their time. This includes all
full-time employees, part-time employees, and contractors. Time tracking should
be done continuously, and always done within 48 hours of the work being done.

You are responsible for making sure that your time is tracked correctly.

## Internal time

Time spent on internal projects should be tracked to the project, and the
project should be marked as internal. This includes time spent on internal
meetings, internal research, and internal development.

When needed, the time can be tracked without a project, but in those cases a
comment should be added to the time entry explaining why the time was tracked
without a project. This should be avoided as much as possible.

## Software

Time tracking must be done in Tripletex, however you are free to use other
integrations to track your time, such as Timely. If you use another integration,
you must make sure that the time is synced to Tripletex.

## Time tracking is not a measure of productivity

Time tracking is not a measure of productivity. It is a measure of how we spend
our time. We do not use time tracking to measure how productive we are.
